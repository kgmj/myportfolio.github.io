						<h2 style="text-align:center">After completing my Politics degree in 2022, like every graduate I was met with that anxiety inducing question:

									“What are you going to do now?”
									</h2>
								<p>A question that I had been dreading, a necessary evil because I truly had no idea. My dream before graduation was to work in the fashion industry. After countless internships from the fashion cupboards of Cosmopolitan magazine to working behind the scenes on music videos, and even at one point working as a freelance stylist myself. I still did not feel certain if pursuing a career in fashion was for me. I still was unsure about what I saw myself doing. 
								
								<p>That summer, after speaking with a friend about my uncertainty, he told me about his friend who had been in a similar predicament the year before and, how she channelled her desire for a creative role into teaching herself the fundamentals of UX design. Eventually landing a role as a Junior UX designer a couple of months later. </p>
								
								<p>After researching UX/UI design for a couple of weeks, I decided to attend an ‘Introduction to Product Design’ event hosted by Black Girls in Tech. I thought I would leave with a better understanding of Product Design and decide to finally pay for that Product Design bootcamp.</p>
								<p style="text-align:center">But funnily enough, instead of developing a love for Product Design – I gained one for coding.</p>
								
								<p>An interest I had always had but was actively discouraged from pursuing it at GCSE level, due to my school worrying I would be uncomfortable being the only girl in the lessons. I was pushed to choose Performing Arts, which was the only subject I was understandably awarded a C due to my crippling stage fright.</p>
								<p>It was at the BGIT event I met an ex-fashion designer (now front-end developer) who encouraged me to look into software development, as it combined the creativity I desired with my love of problem solving. </p>
							    <p>Straight after that I signed up for a Python course with Code First Girls, and after the first lesson I was hooked. Since learning the fundamentals of Python, my aim is to continue to grow my skillset. Consequently, I am now learning SQL with Code First Girls whilst, trying to complete freeCodeCamp’s ‘Scientific Computing with Python’ certificate as well as balancing a fulltime job. </p>
							    <p style="text-align:center">I am now seeking a full-time role which allows me to utilize my coding knowledge whilst, being able to grow and contribute to helping a company achieve their goals. </p>
